99-haskell-problems
===================

My attempt to learn haskell from the standard 99 problems.

http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/99_questions

* Questions 1 to 10: Lists
* Questions 11 to 20: Lists, continued
* Questions 21 to 28: Lists again
* Questions 31 to 41: Arithmetic
* Questions 46 to 50: Logic and codes
* Questions 54A to 60: Binary trees
* Questions 61 to 69: Binary trees, continued
* Questions 70B to 73: Multiway trees
* Questions 80 to 89: Graphs
* Questions 90 to 94: Miscellaneous problems
* Questions 95 to 99: Miscellaneous problems, continued

(Though the problems number from 1 to 99, there are some gaps and some additions marked with letters. There are actually only 88 problems.)
